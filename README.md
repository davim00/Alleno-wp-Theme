Alleno
===

Alleno is a simple, clean and light blogging theme that is perfect for blank slate site creation. It was developed as a simple way to display the author's portfolio, resume and contact info. As such, this first version doesn't offer much in the way of customization and works better with a menu of 4 items or less.

* Widget areas are in the footer in order to put the main content first and formost, with as little distraction as possible.
* The menu stacks on small screens, so it is generally a good idea to not have more than 4 items in it.
* Most of the post formats provided by the core are styled.
* There is only one header style for the entire theme, again, because of the strive towards a small, simple design.

The Future
---

I plan on using this theme as the basis for a larger project, hopefully released as a free theme on Wordpress.org. As such, this theme will get small updates as I add new features. It may even get rewritten, as I have learned new things even since starting it.
